Will return after all of the events declared inside the collect block have
been emitted at least once.

sub collect (&) {

}

=helper our sub collect_any( &block ) is export

Will return after any of the events declared inside the collect block have
been emitted at least once.  Note that it doesn't actually cancel the
unemitted events-- you'll have to do that yourself, if that's what you want.

=cut

sub collect_any (&) {

    my $cv = AE::cv;
    $collect->once( complete => sub { $cv->send } );
    $cv->recv;
}

=helper our sub sleep( Rat $secs ) is export

Sleep for $secs while allowing events to emit (and Coroutine threads to run)

=cut

sub sleep {
    return if $_[-1] <= 0;
    my $cv = AE::cv;
    my $w=AE::timer( $_[-1], 0, sub { $cv->send } );
    $cv->recv;
    return;
}

=helper our sub sleep_until( Rat $epochtime ) is export

Sleep until $epochtime while allowing events to emit (and Coroutine threads to run)

=cut

sub sleep_until {
    my $for = $_[-1] - AE::time;
    return if $for <= 0;
    my $cv = AE::cv;
    my $w=AE::timer( $for, 0, sub { $cv->send } );
    $cv->recv;
    return;

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    use ONE::Coro qw( collect collect_any sleep );

    # Wait for all of a collection of events to trigger once:
    collect {
         ONE::Timer->after( 2 => sub { say "two" } );
         ONE::Timer->after( 3 => sub { say "three" } );
    }; # Returns after 3 seconds having printed "two" and "three"

    # Wait for any of a collection of events to trigger:
    collect_any {
        ONE::Timer->after( 2=> sub { say "two" } );
        ONE::Timer->after( 3=> sub { say "three" } );
    }; 
    # Returns after 2 seconds, having printed 2.  Note however that
    # the other event will still be emitted in another second.  If
    # you were to then execute the sleep below, it would print three.

    # Sleep for 3 seconds without blocking events from firing
    sleep 3;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Strictly speaking, these don't actually (currently) require Coro and are
implemented purely using AnyEvent.  However, they're likely only useful in
such a situation where you want to be able to program procedurally.

If you are using Coro, then sleep is probably better gotten from
L<Coro::AnyEvent>.

The helpers in this module are exported by L<Sub::Exporter>.
