=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use ONE::IO;
    
    # Wait until STDIN is readable, then read one line
    my $stdin = ONE::IO->new( fh=>\*STDIN );
    $stdin->once( readable => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        my( $fh ) = @_;
        chomp( my $input = <$fh>);
        warn "Read: $input\n";
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides very simple IO filehandle watching, wrapping AnyEvent's AE::io
functionality.  Typically you wouldn't use this directly and would use a
higher level object that provides more semantics, like buffering and error
handling.
