This is emitted only after all of the grouped events have been emitted.

=classmethod our group( CodeRef $setup ) returns ONE::Collect

Make any event listeners created inside $setup a part of a new event group
and return that group.

=method our group( CodeRef $setup )

Make any event listeners created inside $setup a part of this event group.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use ONE::Collect;

    # Create an event group
    my $collect = ONE::Collect->group(sub {
        ONE::Timer->after( 2=> sub { say "two" } );
        ONE::Timer->after( 3=> sub { say "three" } );
    });

    # Collect some more events
    $collect->group(sub {
        ONE::Timer->after( 5=> sub { say "five" } );
    });

    # Manually group an event
    ONE::Timer->after( 4 => $collect->listener( sub { say "four" } ) );
    
    # Setup some listeners for the event group
    $collect->once( first    => sub { say "The first event fired" } );
    $collect->once( complete => sub { say "All events fired!" } );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This allows you to reduce a group of unrelated events into a single event. 
Either when the first event is emitted, or after all events have been
emitted at least once.  

=head1 CAVEATS

Be aware when calling other people's code from an event group.  If they
setup event listeners those will be captured by your group as well.
